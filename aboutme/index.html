        <p>
            Hey everybody! My name is Andrea Blake, though I go by Blake for short, and I'm a local here in Rexburg Idaho. 
            My major is Web Development and Design, though if being a wizard or a superhero was a major I'd probably want to do that.
            I'm currently working as a QA Engineer for the Church as an intern, and I'm actually working with web apps a lot, so this class will help me stay on my toes with website basics.
            I enjoy a variety of different hobbies, from reading awesome adventure novels to playing fun board games, though my current hobby is building model kits. (I just got the Mandalorian and Boba Fett kits from Hobby Lobby- can't wait to build them!)
            Looking forward to this class!
